### Task 5. Principles of Testing

Find information about the 7 principles of testing (Google will help) and briefly describe each of them (compare information from at least two sources/articles).

### Results

- 7 testing principles:
    1. **Testing shows the presence, not the absence of defects.** We can't say there is no air if we can't see it. it's just like that, are there bugs — who knows?
    2. **Exhaustive testing is impossible.** If you want to check your calculator for all operations in the [0;1e9] range one by one — congrats, you are certified dumb. You can do it testing only important combinations of numbers and operations.
    3. **Early testing saves time and money.** Think of it: code with defect over time causes to another crucial defect that causes defect. If it can be fixed right now, it should be fixed right now.
    4. **Defects cluster together.** The most important, and yet the fewer clusters, may contain the most crucial defects. For example, if AK-47 can't shoot, what's the meaning of magazine size, how much the rifle weighs, etc..?
    5. **Tests wear out.** We can't do the same tests on changed software, there is no meaning - they lose their value. We should switch to newer tests that include the latest stuff.
    6. **Testing is context dependent.** Bugs have an ability to appear everywhere in your code. There is no universal way to find them.
    7. **Absence-of-defects fallacy.** Nerds doen't need a perfect-pure, clear glasses if thet can't zoom things in. So, even if the software runs flawlessly, if the customer is not satisfied, it's useless.

*P.S.* ISQTB is a reliable source, so I ended up not searching for the 2nd source.
