### Task 2. Types of Testing

There are many bases by which software testing types can be classified: level, functionality, positivity, and others.

In this task, you need to find as much information as possible about different types of testing and give a short description of each type.

    For example:

    By level of testing:

    - **unit testing** — isolated verification of a part of code (by the code itself). These tests are mostly written by developers;

    - **integration testing** — testing the interaction of systems (two or more) with each other;

    - **system testing** — the process of testing the entire software application as a whole, evaluating its overall functionality, performance, and compliance with the specified requirements.

1. Format the completed task as a table in the file _task_2.md._ Try to analyze and reflect as many types of testing as possible.

### Answers

- **Unit testing**           - type of testing where while testing, part of code which isolated from outer space, especially separate functions.
- **Integration testing**    - used to find irregularities between different components, parts of software, etc. interacting with each other.
- **System testing**         - this type of testing should be done on completely integrated systems. They will check if system working properly and can stand for requirements.
- **Acceptance testing**     - the last form of testing, which is used to see if the product is suitable for users and delivers the things that the producer promised.
- **Functional testing**     - a form of software testing in which the software’s features are checked to work as expected according to the given requirements.
- **Non-Functional testing** - testing in which the focus is not on specific functions, but on quality attributes like performance, usability, security, or reliability.
- **Structural testing**     - a type of testing in which tests are written based on the source code, its structure, and internal complexity, not on the specifications or expectations from customers.
- **Confirmation testing**   - the process of re-testing to check if, after fixing an issue, it no longer occurs.
- **Regression testing**     - re-testing after fixing bugs, to check if changes caused new defects in the changed or unchanged parts of the code.
